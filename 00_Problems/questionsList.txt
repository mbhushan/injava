10. In a language, there are only 4 characters ‘h’, ‘i’,’r’, ‘e’. and we have to write a function which takes a string as input and returns whether the given input string is a “valid word” or not.
Definition of valid word :
1. A given word is a valid word if it is of the form h^n i^n r^n e^n where n >=1. (eg: hhiirree)
2. Valid words has concatenation property i.e. if w1 and w2 are valid words w1w2 is also a valid word.

Write a function that given a position returns the digit in that position.
(You could think that this sequence is an array where each cell only holds one digit so given an index return what digit is in that index, however you cannot really create an array since the sequence is infinite, you need a way to based on the index calculate the digit that goes there).
The function has to return a single digit.

index = 100, result = 5
index = 30, result = 2
index = 31, result = 0
index = 1000, result = 3

      54. BFS from each node of the whole graph, classify and mark the membership of each person. Meanwhile, count the number of person in each party, and find the majority party with its marker. This can be done in O(n). Given a person, just check if it belong to the majority party. 
      You are at a political convention with n delegates, each one a member of exactly one political party. It is impossible to tell which political party any delegate belongs to; in particular, you will be summarily ejected from the convention if you ask. However, you can determine whether any two delegates belong to the same party or not by introducing them to each other—members of the same party always greet each other with smiles and friendly handshakes; members of different parties always greet each other with angry stares and insults. (a) Suppose a majority (more than half) of the delegates are from the same political party. Describe an efficient algorithm that identifies a member (anymember) of the majority party.

      59. we will name a number "aggregated number" if this number has the following attribute:
      just like the Fibonacci numbers
      1,1,2,3,5,8,13.....
      the digits in the number can divided into several parts, and the later part is the sum of the former parts.
      like 112358, because 1+1=2, 1+2=3, 2+3=5, 3+5=8
      122436, because 12+24=36
      1299111210, because 12+99=111, 99+111=210
      112112224, because 112+112=224
      so can you provide a function to check whether this number is aggregated number or not?

      There are at most eight servers in a data center. Each server has got a capacity/memory limit. There can be at most 8 tasks that need to be scheduled on those servers. Each task requires certain capacity/memory to run, and each server can handle multiple tasks as long as the capacity limit is not hit. Write a program to see if all of the given tasks can be scheduled or not on the servers?
      Ex:
      Servers capacity limits: 8, 16, 8, 32
      Tasks capacity needs: 18, 4, 8, 4, 6, 6, 8, 8
      For this example, the program should say 'true'.
      Ex2:
      Server capacity limits: 1, 3
      Task capacity needs: 4
      For this example, program should return false.

      70. Rearrange an array using swap with 0.
      You have two arrays src, tgt, containing two permutations of the numbers 0..n-1. You would like to rearrange src so that it equals tgt. The only allowed operations is “swap a number with 0”, e.g. {1,0,2,3} -> {1,3,2,0} (“swap 3 with 0”). Write a program that prints to stdout the list of required operations.
      Practical application:
      Imagine you have a parking place with n slots and n-1 cars numbered from 1..n-1. The free slot is represented by 0 in the problem. If you want to rearrange the cars, you can only move one car at a time into the empty slot, which is equivalent to “swap a number with 0”.
      Example:
      src={1,0,2,3}; tgt={0,2,3,1};

      74. Given a server that has requests coming in. Design a data structure such that you can fetch the count of the number requests in the last second, minute and hour.
      Solu: I think a circular buffer will work here. If the accuracy at 1s is acceptable, we can maintain a 3600 sized circular array, with three pointer, now, lastMinEnd, lastHourEnd. We also maintain three two counter, lastMinCount, lastHourCount. Whenever, a request comes in, we update the A[now], also lastMinCount, lastHourCount. Whenever, 1second passes, move lastMinEnd and lastHourEnd forward, and update their count. Since this is a circular buffer, pay attention to the boundary condition. 
      Although a dqueue also works, it need to store each request, therefore not as spatial efficient as above solution.

      A river separates two banks, there are 3 men and 3 lions on one side that need to be taken across using a boat that can carry 2 entities at a time(irrespective of being a lion and man), subject to the condition that at no point can you have more number of lions than men on any bank, as then the lions would eat the man/men. Solve the puzzle. Then code it to make it a generic program that solves the puzzle for X men and Y lions.

      81. Given a dictionary, and a list of letters ( or consider as a string), find the longest word that only uses letters from the string. [I didn't meet this question, what's the best solution?]

      82. Count the number of positive integers less than N that does not contains digit 4.
      Solu: In order to avoid 4, a digit a_d >= 4, it only has a_d choice, if it is smaller than 4, it has a_d+1 choice. Then multiply all digits

Suppose we put N keys into this M-slotted hash table, what is the probability that there will be a slot with i elements? i could vary from 0 to N.


      84. Given an 8x8 chess board, you have a bishop that moves from the current to the target position. write a code to find the minimum path from the current to the target position.
      If source’s color != target’s color, it cannot reach 
      Else if they are on one diagonal, return 1
      Else return 2

      85. Given 2 arrays A,B, where x(A.length) < y(B.length), we want to insert (y - x) 0's to A at various places such that A*B is minimum. For instance, if A = (1, -1) and B = (1,2, 3, 4), then inserting two 0's in the middle of A such that A = (1, 0, 0, -1) would minimize A*B. I think he was looking for a dynamic problem solution.

      89. A rooted binary tree with keys in its nodes has the binary search tree property (BST property) if, for every node, the keys in its left subtree are smaller than its own key, and the keys in its right subtree are larger than its own key. It has the heap property if, for every node, the keys of its children are all smaller than its own key. You are given a set of n binary tree nodes that each contain an integer i and an integer j. No two i values are equal and no two j values are equal. We must assemble the nodes into a single binary tree where the i values obey the BST property and the j values obey the heap property. If you pay attention only to the second key in each node, the tree looks like a heap, and if you pay attention only to the first key in each node, it looks like a binary search tree.Describe a recursive algorithm for assembling such a tree

      90. Given two unsorted int arrays, find the kth element in the merged, sorted array.
      example:
      int[] a= [3 1 7]
      int[] b = [4 9]
      k: 3
      return 4.
      Solu: maxHeap of size k, compare each newly element with top of heap, replace it if has a smaller one. Finally, the top of maxHeap is the result. But select kth smallest from one array only needs O(n) time. 

      Anagram solver. An anagram is two words that contains the same letters 
      the same amount of times. For example, angle and angel are anagrams. Given a
      dictionary, perform some preprocessing for a anagram solver. The anagram 
      solver takes a string as input and prints out a list of all anagrams 
      contained in the dictionary.

       Meeting place. You have a city with streets running parallel both 
       horizonally and vetically creating a giant grid. The dimension of each grid 
       is 1 X 1. All street corners in the city can be represented by a coordinate 
       (int x, int y). Given an array of people represented by their closest street
       corner, calculate a street corner to meet where their combined traveling 
       distance is the shortest. Assume everyone can only travel on road. For 
       example, the traveling distance from [1,1] to [2,2] is 2.

       100. You are given an array A of k values which contain int values in sorted (asec) order. Find top k values (asec) which can either be the number from the array A, or sum of any two numbers from A or sum of any three numbers from A. So, if A's values are represented as : a1,a2,...,ak , the possible numbers can be: a(i), a(i)+a(j), a(i)+a(j)+a(l) for any i,j,l < k
       Ex: A[7] = {3,4,5,15,19,20,25}
       output B[7] = {3,4,5,(3+4),(3+5),(4+5),(3+4+5)}

       Why Java has class-level private methods, i.e. Person p1 can access Person p2’s private method
       The private modifier enforces Encapsulation principle.
       The idea is that 'outer world' should not make changes to Person internal processes because Person implementation may change over time (and you would have to change the whole outer world to fix the differences in implementation - which is nearly to impossible).
       When instance of Person accesses internals of other Person instance - you can be sure that both instances always know the details of implementation of Person. If the logic of internal to Person processes is changed - all you have to do is change the code of Person.


       101. Suppose we are given an array A[1 .. n] with the special property that A[1] ≥ A[2] and
       A[n − 1] ≤ A[n]. We say that an element A[x] is a local minimum if it is less than or equal
       to both its neighbors, or more formally, if A[x − 1] ≥ A[x] and A[x] ≤ A[x + 1]. For example,
       there are ﬁve local minima in the following array:
       9 7 7 2 1 3 7 5 4 7 3 3 4 8 6 9
       We can obviously ﬁnd a local minimum in O(n) time by scanning through the array. Describe

       121. You are given a String number containing the digits of a
       phone number (the number of digits, n, can be any positive integer) . To help you memorize
       the number, you want to divide it into groups of contiguous digits. Each group must contain
       exactly 2 or 3 digits. There are three kinds of groups:
       • Excellent: A group that contains only the same digits. For example, 000 or 77.
       • Good: A group of 3 digits, 2 of which are the same. For example, 030, 229 or 166.
       • Usual: A group in which all the digits are distinct. For example, 123 or 90.
       The quality of a group assignment is defined as
       2 × (number of excellent groups) + (number of good groups)
       Divide the number into groups such that the quality is maximized. Design an efficient

       delete(p)--removes the value p from the set
       getrandom()--returns a random value from the set (all items should be equally likely). (Assume you have access to some nice random() function.)
       Need not write actual code, just sketch a structure to implement this efficiently.

So if input (1,6) (2,3) (4,11), (1,6) should be returned. Some suggest to use Interval Tree to get this done in O(logn), but I did not understand how to construct and use the Interval Tree after reading its wiki page. Is there any other way to do it? If Interval tree is the only option, please educate me how to construct/use one. Thanks.
